# Game Design Document — SEVER

## Core Feeling

**"Visualized Stress."**

The game should feel like tightening a guitar string until it's about to snap. The player oscillates between the intellectual calm of calculating angles and the visceral shock of sudden, violent momentum. It is the feeling of holding a heavy weight and releasing it at the perfect second.

## Game Fantasy

You are not a general commanding troops; you are a **Saboteur of Physics**.

The arena is a void. The Core is a massive, rusting iron sphere. You are controlling the invisible forces of tension and gravity. Your goal is to use your opponent's own strength against them—like high-stakes digital Judo.

## Target Players

* **Demographic:** Universal. Ages 10 to 100.
* **Psychographic:** People who love "Aha!" moments. Players who enjoy Chess/Go but want more visual feedback. Competitive players who value pure skill over randomness.
* **Skill Level:** "Low floor, infinite ceiling." Easy to understand (pull the ball), impossible to master (predicting complex multi-vector chaos).

## Player Experience

### The Core Loop

The game is played in turns on a circular arena with a heavy central Core.

1. **Assess Equilibrium:** Analyze the current web of "Tethers" (bungee cords) holding the Core in place.

2. **Apply Force (The Build):**
   - **Anchor:** Attach a new tether from your wall to the Core to pull it toward you.
   - **Reinforce:** Strengthen a tether to increase tension.

3. **Release Force (The Snap):**
   - **SEVER:** Cut a tether (yours or an exposed enemy's). This causes the Core to "slingshot" based on the remaining forces.

4. **Resolution:** The physics engine resolves the movement. If the Core hits the enemy's wall, you win. If played perfectly by both sides, the Core remains suspended in a trembling, perfect stalemate.

### Emotional Journey

- **Winning:** Feels like releasing a trap. A sudden, violent release of potential energy.
- **Losing:** Feels like being crushed by your own ambition. You saw it coming, but couldn't stop it.
- **A Draw:** Not a boring standstill, but a terrifying equilibrium where one wrong move collapses the entire system.

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals

1. Create a fully functional, deterministic browser game that simulates realistic weight and tension
2. The Core must feel HEAVY — not floaty, but dangerous
3. Allow players to Attach, Reinforce, and SEVER tethers
4. Visually represent stress (vibrating lines, camera shake, particle sparks)
5. Deploy via a single HTML/JS entry point for easy deployment

### Unique Value Proposition

* **Creates a new genre:** "Turn-Based Physics Strategy"
* **Solves the "Boring Draw" problem:** In SEVER, a draw is a High-Tension Standoff where the board trembles with potential energy
* **"Absolute Cinema":** Strategy games are usually visually static. SEVER is kinetic — a winning move is screen-shaking, metal-screeching impact
